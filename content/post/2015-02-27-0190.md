oh the gifts god gave to you
and how you squandered them today.
do you even remember how to pray?
or how it feels to lose your breath
in the tempered throes of the spirit?
give up on this voided passion,
rupture the stillness you let win.
let dawn burst your heart of tin.
crying games are no more a crutch
than your impotent dream for peace.
