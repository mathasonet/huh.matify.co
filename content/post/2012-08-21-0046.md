My momma’s a quiet woman.
Between the cracks ‘round her eyes and the cracks spreading out from her mouth you’d think she led a good life ‘til now. Probably a looker in high-school with a smile and a laugh that wrecked every boy brave enough to chat her up. I wouldn’t know though. She doesn’t say much.
I bugged her so bad once that she showed me what was inside the top-left dresser drawer. Its key was a long, brass piece with three teeth that never left her neck. When she finally pulled the drawer open all that was inside was a scratched tin box. Her gentle fingers lifted it and she placed it on the bed. She removed the lid and I peered inside. There were some crayons, a rock, a small box of rolling papers, and a long, white satin glove folded neatly.
My momma made no sense.
