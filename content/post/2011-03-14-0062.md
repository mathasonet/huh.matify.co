<p>I twist the experiences between my toes<br />until they fray and sever<br />'fore I drop them to the valley below<br />where no seeker, at least, not one I know<br />would not be lost forever.</p>
<p>A home they make this far below<br />free from neglect or age.<br />Were they to stay connected still<br />immediately would I have lost the will<br />and ceased from it all, I&#8217;d wage.</p>
<p>Instead solace is to be found in dreams:<br />dawning hope across my darkened brow.<br />To dwell on these without much thought<br />to whatever pain inaction wrought,<br />is a reality life will not endow.</p>
