<p>at least his arms, lord.<br /> i have no internal compass<br /> to direct myself in their absence.</p>
<p>or even his hands, father?<br />with their sinewed grip<br />on this flighty heart.</p>
<p>dayspring of a hope misplaced,<br />protector of a man disgraced,</p>
<p>i&#8217;ve lost his comfort, abba,<br />and for my wickedness and sin:<br />i&#8217;m left to know the dark again.</p>
