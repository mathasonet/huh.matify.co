I'm leaving Tumblr but talking about it feels ridiculous. There's nothing left for me there and in all reality it has just become the worst time sink of my life these last six years.

The social aspects I'll miss,Â but I fear they just enable me to not give a shit about what I'm producing.

Which until now hasn't been much.
