<i>do you regret me?</i>
seeing us in such a state
had left me empty.
and yet I'd given you plenty.
<i>do you want more?</i>
pain in your touch, I know you hid
those reasons you're hurt for.
tell me where went your candor.

treat this like our last goodbye:
left alone with two dry eyes.
and those heaving breaths beneath my chest
will not replace the space you've left.

<i>had you the power?</i>
silence was just the tool you used
as you withered and cowered.
climb on down from the tower.
<i>had you a purpose?</i>
in reducing me to such
that I felt fully worthless.
tell me how I deserved this.

<em>believe</em> this is our last goodbye:
let us tremble soft as we face the lie
that our arms wrapped 'round the other's side
meant we never had much else to hide.
