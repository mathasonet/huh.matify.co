<p>To this day there&#8217;ve been no whispers,<br />in the distance I&#8217;ve seen no ships<br />calling out to warn or welcome;<br />in this harbor warm and wet.<br />Just a child when I sat in earnest<br />awaiting the arms of an absentee.<br />I sought and strove as I grew sensible,<br />while my heart, withdrawn, learned its beat.</p>
<p>It&#8217;d be false to claim I&#8217;d left it thusly.<br />Only a bit older did I opt to open<br />and let its rhythm reach beyond my writ.<br />[unfinished]</p>
