<p>I dreamt her once.<br />I couldn&#8217;t see from her perspective<br />so she lent me her eyes.<br />And I lost them.<br />I searched the world,<br />only to find ones discarded and used.<br />When I was done<br />and, downtroddenly, had returned home<br />she, blind, greeted me warmly.<br />Alarmed by her smile<br />I confessed to my crime.<br />"I couldn&#8217;t see<br />the things you wanted me to.<br />So I took on your eyes and I saw the world<br />until I lost them.<br />I&#8217;ve traversed the world<br />and still they are missing.<br />You must take mine.&#8221;<br />Her hand grasped my own<br />"They were given to you<br />for you desired to see what I do.<br />That you have acted<br />proves you have seen.&#8221;</p>
