I wrote these during chapel today. They aren’t polished writing, but they are what’s on my mind. It also happens that they don’t really constitute a blog post anywhere else.

(Keep in mind these are only related in the events to which they were reacting.)

—

My mouth will not sing
when my soul does not stir.

For the pulse of these actions
flat-lines facing distractions.

A witness sits among you
lacking comfort in your distance.

Absorbing the Truth
so plainly washing these blind souls.

”That any should perish,”
that any should exclude.

Don’t merely discuss what is “right,”
live.

How can I share this love
when your doctrine is impossible foreign?

Don’t question your placement
as you preach to the passive.
(You’ve stepped up to the plate,
and so God must be with you?)

Of course we don’t understand,
we are products of the fallen!
Our only shred of understanding
comes from our fallen views of this world.

Anger accepts that I
am weaker in soul than I
could ever understand.
