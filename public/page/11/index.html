      <p>I wrote these during chapel today. They aren’t polished writing, but they are what’s on my mind. It also happens that they don’t really constitute a blog post anywhere else.</p>

<p>(Keep in mind these are only related in the events to which they were reacting.)</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>My mouth will not sing<br />
when my soul does not stir.</p>

<p>For the pulse of these actions<br />
flat-lines facing distractions.</p>

<p>A witness sits among you<br />
lacking comfort in your distance.</p>

<p>Absorbing the Truth<br />
so plainly washing these blind souls.</p>

<p>”That any should perish,”<br />
that any should exclude.</p>

<p>Don’t merely discuss what is “right,”<br />
live.</p>

<p>How can I share this love<br />
when your doctrine is impossible foreign?</p>

<p>Don’t question your placement<br />
as you preach to the passive.<br />
(You’ve stepped up to the plate,<br />
and so God must be with you?)</p>

<p>Of course we don’t understand,<br />
we are products of the fallen!<br />
Our only shred of understanding<br />
comes from our fallen views of this world.</p>

<p>Anger accepts that I<br />
am weaker in soul than I<br />
could ever understand.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m lost in breathing,<br />this feeling is fleeting,<br />my eyes shut out your words.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Arms on me constrict<br />to inflict their edict;<br />I am devoid of your strength.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Ennui in soul<br />takes a role of control<br />and my feet lack a path.</p>

      <p>Lessons don&#8217;t come along<br />as often as I&#8217;m wrong.<br />I wish I would seek,<br />for a time, to be meek.</p>
<p>For it&#8217;s in the night we fight,<br />scratching, to make right<br />the ideals we&#8217;ve met,<br />the standards we&#8217;ve set.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll stand to decree,<br />out of our shared misery,<br />a call to include<br />those called to collude.</p>
<p>But where are we left?<br />With our pride bereft<br />a doubt settles in,<br />seizing hold of our win.</p>
<p>They steal from us thunder<br />and we burst asunder<br />as if, just to say,<br />it&#8217;s preferable that way.</p>
<p>With open palms and open hearts<br />forgetting all our false starts,<br />it&#8217;s time that we act<br />'lest from our cause we subtract.</p>
<p>We <em>must</em> rise and sing<br />'til the day that our king<br />claims us as his queen;<br />a wonder to be seen.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll speak out for our love,<br />defend not a lack thereof.<br />His words are our tools;<br />our words just birth fools.</p>

      <p>We were made on differing planes.<br />I lower my eyes<br />staring at the lines on my hands<br />and wonder what you thought of yours.</p>
<p>Did you feel trapped?<br />Or was knowledge your peace?<br />Because I lack your ability,<br />even being made like yourself.</p>
<p>I love all of your words;<br />watch as I squeeze them dry.<br />They contrast with my eyes<br />even though you&#8217;re all I&#8217;ve followed.</p>

      <p>The world snapped level and into focus. Warm sunlight leaked in through the slanted metal blinds onto the cluttered floor and the blanket covering her. It was too hot. To her right sat the computer chair, turned open for the next time she needed to type a paper or surf the internet. All of this, she took in effortlessly when her body sprang itself up. It was while she was using all this sensory information to place herself when her body realized it had forgotten how to breathe. Her head snapped from side to side quickly, suffocating as it screamed for oxygen. When her body finally caught up it triggered a deep inhale that had never tasted so sweet. In a motion to rival that which woke her, her body laid back down gently. In her chest her heart still beat wildly from the event. She knew she was awake. She was safe and in her bed, and had only woken up after—the content of her dream returned from a temporary exile. Nails dug into her palms as she squeezed, clenching her jaw tighter than she knew possible. She wanted to scream for him, for this boy. It had only been a dream, right; all of it just data collected and filed by her mind?<br />
She stretched her fingers out and closed her eyes. They were warm with tears. There was no way it had been a dream; no way could she have created that all on her own. But she was back in her room, wasn’t she? Were anyone to look, she would be found between her familiar sheets and beneath that same window she had slept under for over 17 years. In a short eternity of moments she opened her eyes and saw what was expected; however, it did not give the comfort of familiarity for which she longed. A minute passed, followed by another. Finally tapping into some unknown courage she slipped her feet out from the sheets, letting her body follow. Standing on legs unfit for movement, she managed to shuffle her way to the door.<br />
<em>      I’m alone</em>, she noted, <em>no one from it is here</em>. Hardwood flooring met her carpeted room at the door frame and her foot, in turn, met the hardwood flooring. The drastic change in temperature made her stand on the balls of her feet. She briskly walked down the hall in her invisible heels. Pictures of the childhood she knew she had lived peered out from their plastic and glass prisons. A glance was an unnecessary act she thought might affirm her dream theory but the dream would not be shaken from her thoughts. His fear flowed through her veins, their adrenaline shared as it pumped through their joint heart. The effects seemed to be waning though, enough that maybe soon her body would calm itself. She waited.</p>
