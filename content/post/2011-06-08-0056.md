<p>Boy, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve told you,<br /> lest I show myself a fright.<br /> In dreams, I take delight<br /> in letting fingertips sail<br /> around your curves.<br /> My eyes scan down your flesh,<br /> willing every inch of skin<br /> closer and closer to my own.<br /> Persperation fails to cool<br /> as we grasp each other tighter.<br /> United, we connect<br /> our lonely bodies; find<br /> something worthy of holding.<br /> I long for this to be unfolding<br /> but in words it&#8217;ll remain, unknown.</p>
