<p>Of all I have left<br /> that survived the frost,<br /> I cling to my island.<br /> It holds me,<br /> weathered,<br /> as the pressure slips<br /> and I lose my grip.<br /> Fleeting,<br /> fleeting is the warmth<br /> from my fingertips<br /> and toes;<br /> I watch it escape me.<br /> Desparately reaching out<br /> to reclaim what&#8217;s mine,<br /> what remains.</p>
