<p>Lessons don&#8217;t come along<br />as often as I&#8217;m wrong.<br />I wish I would seek,<br />for a time, to be meek.</p>
<p>For it&#8217;s in the night we fight,<br />scratching, to make right<br />the ideals we&#8217;ve met,<br />the standards we&#8217;ve set.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll stand to decree,<br />out of our shared misery,<br />a call to include<br />those called to collude.</p>
<p>But where are we left?<br />With our pride bereft<br />a doubt settles in,<br />seizing hold of our win.</p>
<p>They steal from us thunder<br />and we burst asunder<br />as if, just to say,<br />it&#8217;s preferable that way.</p>
<p>With open palms and open hearts<br />forgetting all our false starts,<br />it&#8217;s time that we act<br />'lest from our cause we subtract.</p>
<p>We <em>must</em> rise and sing<br />'til the day that our king<br />claims us as his queen;<br />a wonder to be seen.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll speak out for our love,<br />defend not a lack thereof.<br />His words are our tools;<br />our words just birth fools.</p>
