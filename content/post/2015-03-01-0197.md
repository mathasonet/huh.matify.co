Were you even considering taking the right steps? You're your own biggest critic and still you let yourself get away with a passively benign existence. You have the capabilities of crafting and sculpting a world all your own and still you thrive off the spent imagination of others. There is more for you yet, tiny man. Inside of you waits an adulthood of stories and bad poetry. Grab on to anything you can find and seize it for its duration, only when it is spent can you leave it behind for the greener thoughts to come.

It's time you stop giving up so easily on your works.
