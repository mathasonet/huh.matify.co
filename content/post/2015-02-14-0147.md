in dreams i see the horses,
charging on to lead the night.
and in the silence of their passing
i become the fleeing light.

i become the fleeing light,
caught on candle, torch, and spit.
left to warm, direct, and comfort:
minding that the dark will lift.

minding that the dark will lift,
and knowing still the price of fear,
I gently guide them to their slumber
â€™til i all but disappear.
