<p>It was all too<br />   vivid;<br />a life she&#8217;d never<br />   touched.</p>
<p>  It burned<br />itself in her retinas.<br />  It lingered<br />in all her senses.<br />  It wasn&#8217;t<br />    hers.</p>
<p>    Who<br />  was she<br />in this fourth dimension?<br />    How<br />  did she<br />become this person?<br />    Could<br />this have been her<br />  all along?</p>
<p>    No!<br />  she cried,<br />    these<br />  aren&#8217;t mine<br />to hold on to.<br />There is a life<br />  I must<br />    relate;<br />  else it<br />will be all for<br />    naught.</p>
<p>This boy<br />    will<br />    live.</p>
