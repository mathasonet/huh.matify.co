courage <a title="courage" href="http://matify.link/2011/03/14/courage-knows-little-of-the-hollows-of-my-heart/" target="_blank">knew little</a> of the hollows of my heart.
now for you itâ€™s landed on my shores
shouting out my darkened chords,    
willing earnest peace to make its start.
still with cooling words and ever-frosted core
muscles housing forgotten ways to impart
the humanity that still yearns to restart.
someday this thankfulness I will bear forth.
