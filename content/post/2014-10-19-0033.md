<p>ringing words,<br />the stinging’ll burn my years up.<br />lessons spurned,<br />the flesh is proud and yearning. <br />now i’m in and out of love.</p>
<p>have i forgotten us for newer lies to live?<br />still i run my hands over your chest.<br />have i forgotten us for unfulfilling touch?<br />still i run my hands over your chest.</p>
<p>you have been<br />clearly of the good ones.<br />distracting me from the painful breeze<br />of bitter longings unreleased,<br />thinking there was hope.<br />now i’m in and out of love.</p>
<p>have i forgotten him for want of final thoughts?<br />still i run my hands over your chest.<br />have i forgotten him in learning of the loss?<br />still i run my hands over your chest.</p>
