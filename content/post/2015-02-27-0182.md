she dances on broken toes,
painful as she goes and grows
and stretches out in soundless space.
her eyes find the warning place.

keeping time to thought-out crimes
that etch their reason into lines
of typeset flowers on tired screens.
let those dreamers keep their dreams!

let those schemers flirt to impress
their filthy fingers on musicâ€™s dress.
to her their demise is psalmodic ode:
that dreamers often die.
